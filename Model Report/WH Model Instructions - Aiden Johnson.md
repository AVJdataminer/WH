## Model Implementation Instructions
#### Requirements:
 * Python version 3.6.1

#### Packages:
 * pandas
 * numpy
 * sklearn
 * joblib
 * math
 * pickle
 * warnings
 * os
### Steps:
[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/edjdce9c2mj4d7z/RF_ML.zip?dl=0) and Unzip the `RF_ML.zip`  

 \- Save the `run_model.py`  and `rf_model.joblib` to your working directory  

 \- Open the command line and change the directory to where you saved `run_model.py`  and `rf_model.joblib`  

 \- Type `python run_model.py` and press Enter

 \- Once you see a message that says `Enter file name: ` type the name of your input CSV dataset for example `file.csv`  

 \- Model should run in one minute or less on a laptop with 16GB of RAM

 \- When the model is complete you will see both the RMSE and MAE printed in the command line.  
 
 \- The program will have written the model predictions out to a file in the same directory calling it `predictions.csv`
